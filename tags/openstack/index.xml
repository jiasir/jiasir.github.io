Because I tried almost all popular tools and We need a low learning cost, flexible, production-oriented high-availability level automated build tool. Below is a simple comparison of some open source solutions:
Juju solutions for OpenStack OpenStack Autopilot puppetlabs-openstack openstack-ansible Kolla RDO(Packstack) TripleO Juju solutions for OpenStack Juju is a good tool for provisioning and orchestration, but bad to deploy OpenStack.</description></item><item><title>Multiple Provider Network Configuration in Mitaka</title><link>https://jiasir.io/posts/2017/multiple-provider-network-configuration-in-mitaka/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jiasir.io/posts/2017/multiple-provider-network-configuration-in-mitaka/</guid><description>Neutron provider VLANs are Neutron networks that map directly to an 802.1Q VLAN in the cloud provider&amp;rsquo;s physical network infrastructure.
This is the example configuration of neutron network node:
On the neutron.conf file:
[DEFAULT] core_plugin = ml2 service_plugins = router On the ml2_conf.ini file:
[ml2] type_drivers = flat,vlan,vxlan tenant_network_types = vxlan mechanism_drivers = linuxbridge,l2population extension_drivers = port_security [ml2_type_flat] flat_networks = provider [ml2_type_vlan] network_vlan_ranges = provider [securitygroup] firewall_driver = iptables We also need to configure the physical switches as trunk not access mode:</description></item></channel></rss>
